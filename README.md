# THz_Thin_Film_Spectroscopy
This code is set up to take THz time domain spectroscopy data and calculate the optical parameters in equilibrium as well as after photo-excitation. Due to the deep penetration depth of THz, the photo-excited material is modeled as a thin excited layer on top of the bulk material containing the equilibrium response.
